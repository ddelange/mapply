[`mapply`](https://github.com/ddelange/mapply) provides a sensible multi-core apply function for Pandas.

### mapply vs. pandarallel vs. swifter

Where [`pandarallel`](https://pypi.org/project/pandarallel) relies on in-house multiprocessing and progressbars, and hard-codes 1 chunk per worker (which will cause idle CPUs when one chunk happens to be more expensive than the others), [`swifter`](https://pypi.org/project/swifter) relies on the heavy [`dask`](https://pypi.org/project/dask) framework for multiprocessing (converting to Dask DataFrames and back). In an attempt to find the golden mean, `mapply` is highly customizable and remains lightweight, using [`tqdm`](https://pypi.org/project/tqdm) for progressbars and leveraging the powerful [`pathos`](https://pypi.org/project/pathos) framework, which shadows Python's built-in multiprocessing module using [`dill`](https://pypi.org/project/dill) for universal pickling.


## Installation

This pure-Python, OS independent package is available on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/mapply):

```sh
$ pip install mapply
```


## Usage

[![readthedocs](https://readthedocs.org/projects/mapply/badge/?version=latest)](https://mapply.readthedocs.io)

For documentation, see [mapply.readthedocs.io](https://mapply.readthedocs.io/en/stable/_code_reference/mapply.html).

```py
import pandas as pd
import mapply

mapply.init(
    n_workers=-1,
    chunk_size=100,
    max_chunks_per_worker=8,
    progressbar=False,
)

df = pd.DataFrame({"A": list(range(100))})

# avoid unnecessary multiprocessing:
# due to chunk_size=100, this will act as regular apply.
# set chunk_size=1 to skip this check and let max_chunks_per_worker decide.
df["squared"] = df.A.mapply(lambda x: x**2)
```
