    Subsequent calls to this function will create/overwrite methods with new settings.

    Args:
        n_workers: Maximum amount of workers (processes) to spawn. Might be lowered
            depending on chunk_size and max_chunks_per_worker. Will throw a warning if
            set higher than is sensible (see :meth:`mapply.parallel.sensible_cpu_count`).
        chunk_size: Minimum amount of columns/rows per chunk. Higher value means a higher
            threshold to go multi-core. Set to 1 to let max_chunks_per_worker decide.
        max_chunks_per_worker: Upper limit on amount of chunks per worker. Will lower
            n_chunks determined by chunk_size if necessary. Set to 0 to skip this check.
        progressbar: Whether to wrap the chunks in a :meth:`tqdm.auto.tqdm`.
        apply_name: Method name for the patched apply function.
